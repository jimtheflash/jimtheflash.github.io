This is the personal website for Jim Kloet (*Kloet* rhymes with *flute*). I live with my family in Chicago, where I work as a data person trying to help professionals make better decisions. I also make music, and art, and software, and occasionally write about stuff that I think is interesting.

Thanks for visiting!
