Here's some stuff I work on when I'm not working for the man.

## Active Projects

#### [Slam Dunk Betting Services](https://slamdunkservices.github.io/)

My partners and I developed machine learning and artificial intelligence tools to predict the outcomes of events in NBA games and identify plays that are +EV. We've been doing this since gambling was legalized in Illinois, and recently opened up our tools to subscribers.

#### [DopeGenerativeArt](https://www.etsy.com/shop/DopeGenerativeArt)

I was initially inspired to make generative art in `ggplot2` by the work of [Antonio Sánchez Chinchón](https://fronkonstin.com/about/) and I opened up an Etsy shop to peddle my wares.

#### Music

I sell music gear, so far only amps and guitars, on [Reverb](https://reverb.com/shop/jims-gear-bazaar-659). If you have sparkly guitars or basses that you're willing to sell or trade, LET ME KNOW.

I also play and produce music, but I don't record it very often. Here's [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo8eFKuBYFM) representative example of my singer-songwritering.

## Archived & Privatized Projects

#### [chi311dash](https://github.com/jimtheflash/chi311dash)

_Archived_
I live in Chicago, which has a public data portal of interesting information, including 311 requests. So I built a repo to grab 311 request data and plot it on a map of Chicago broken down by neighborhoods.

#### [betfinder](https://github.com/jimtheflash/betfinder)

_Privatized behind Slam Dunk_
Sports data is what got me interested in data science. `betfinder` is a repo with functions for extracting selected wager info from selected sports books.

#### [gambling_dashboards](https://github.com/jimtheflash/gambling_dashboards)

_Privatized behind Slam Dunk_
A repo with a single `shiny` dashboard surfacing some of the insights from `betfinder`'s automated production runs.
